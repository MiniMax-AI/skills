Tech stack: React / Next.js, Tailwind CSS. | Official |
| `fullstack-dev` | Full-stack backend architecture and frontend-backend integration. REST API design, auth flows (JWT, session, OAuth), real-time features (SSE, WebSocket), database integration (SQL / NoSQL), production hardening, and release checklist. Guided workflow: requirements → architecture → implementation. | Official |
| `android-native-dev` | Android native application development with Material Design 3. Kotlin / Jetpack Compose, adaptive layouts, Gradle configuration, accessibility (WCAG), build troubleshooting, performance optimization, and motion system. | Official |
| `ios-application-dev` | iOS application development guide covering UIKit, SnapKit, and SwiftUI. Touch targets, safe areas, navigation patterns, Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, accessibility, collection views, and Apple HIG compliance. | Official |
| `shader-dev` | Comprehensive GLSL shader techniques for creating stunning visual effects — ray marching, SDF modeling, fluid simulation, particle systems, procedural generation, lighting, post-processing, and more. ShaderToy-compatible. | Official |
| `gif-sticker-maker` | Convert photos (people, pets, objects, logos) into 4 animated GIF stickers with captions. Funko Pop / Pop Mart style, powered by MiniMax Image & Video Generation API. | Official |
| `minimax-pdf` | Generate, fill, and reformat PDF documents with a token-based design system. CREATE polished PDFs from scratch (15 cover styles), FILL existing form fields, or REFORMAT documents into a new design. Print-ready output with typography and color derived from document type. | Official |
| `pptx-generator` | Generate, edit, and read PowerPoint presentations. Create from scratch with PptxGenJS (cover, TOC, content, section divider, summary slides), edit existing PPTX via XML workflows, or extract text with markitdown. | Official |
| `minimax-xlsx` | Open, create, read, analyze, edit, or validate Excel/spreadsheet files (.xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, .tsv). Covers creating new xlsx from scratch via XML templates, reading and analyzing with pandas, editing existing files with zero format loss, formula recalculation, validation, and professional financial formatting. | Official |
| `minimax-docx` | Professional DOCX document creation, editing, and formatting using OpenXML SDK (.NET). Three pipelines: create new documents from scratch, fill/edit content in existing documents, or apply template formatting with XSD validation gate-check. | Official |
| `vision-analysis` | Analyze, describe, and extract information from images using vision AI models. Supports describe, OCR, UI mockup review, chart data extraction, and object detection. Powered by MiniMax VL API with OpenAI GPT-4V fallback. | Community |
| `markdown-mcp` | MCP tool for efficient markdown file reading and editing. Replace Python scripts with direct file operations — get file info, grep, read sections, replace text, insert lines via MCP tools. Python stdlib only, no dependencies. | Community |
| `context-maintainer` | Maintain persistent project context across AI agent sessions. Creates and updates `.context/` files (goals, architecture, decisions, active files, stale files). Triggers on git commit, context threshold, or session end. Gitignored by default. | Community |
| `context-search` | Search and retrieve persistent context across sessions. Works with `.context/` files — get active context, search decisions, find file history. Optional QMD integration for semantic search. Export to Obsidian vault supported. | Community |
